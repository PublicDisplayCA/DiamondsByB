				<h1>ABOUT DIAMONDS BY B</h1>
				<hr></hr>
				<p>
					Diamonds By B started when the founder Brent was looking for an engagement ring for his now wife Michelle. He realized quickly that the guidance and information throughout the process was lacking from the big format retailers which left him overwhelmed and confused. That was by chance, he encountered his now business partner and mentor Wayne.
				</p>
	<img src="resources/about_B/Diamonds_By_B_about.jpg">
				<p>
					After purchasing an engagement ring, he started to reflect on how he could help guide others through the process of engagement ring shopping. This gave Brent the idea to start his own company. He wanted to ensure that as much guidance and support could be provided for those looking to purchase an engagement ring or any custom jewellery they had in mind.
