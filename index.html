				<h1>ABOUT DIAMONDS BY B</h1>
				<hr></hr>
				<p>
				Diamonds By B started when the Founder Brent was looking for an engagement ring for 
his now wife Michelle. He quickly realized that information and guidance was lacking from different retailers which left him overwhelmed and confused. That was until a chance encounter led him to his now business partner and mentor Wayne. 
				</p>
	<img src="resources/about_B/Diamonds_By_B_about.jpg">
				<p>
After purchasing an engagement ring, he started to reflect on how he could help guide others through the process of engagement ring shopping. This gave Brent the idea to start his own company. He wanted to ensure that as much guidance and support could be provided for those looking to purchase an engagement ring or any type of jewellery they had in mind.
